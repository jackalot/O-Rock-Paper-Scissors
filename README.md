# O-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Plan:
Playme function {
    does a math.floor(math.random() * 2) + 1 
    0: rock. 1: paper 2: scissors
    prompt the user for thier choice
    make the users choice lower case
    console.log both the computers choice ( the math . floor variable
    make switch statement to see what number the computer got
    make seperate functions based off the player to simplify if comparisons, IE: playerChoseRock {}
    in these functions, console.log if the player lost
}
